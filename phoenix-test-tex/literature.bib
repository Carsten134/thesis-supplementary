	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the spectral analysis of wide sense stationary time series which possess a spectral density function and whose fourth moment functions satisfy an integrability condition (which includes Gaussian processes). Consistent estimates are obtained for the spectral density function as well as for the spectral distribution function and a general class of spectral averages. Optimum consistent estimates are chosen on the basis of criteria involving the notions of order of consistency and asymptotic variance. The problem of interpolating the estimated spectral density, so that only a finite number of quantities need be computed to determine the entire graph, is also discussed. Both continuous and discrete time series are treated.},

	abstract = {Several general classes of estimates of the spectral density function of a stationary time series are introduced, which are shown to include most estimates previously suggested by various researchers. Asymptotic expressions are given for the mean square error of these estimates. We thus determine, for each estimate, the class of time series for whose spectral density it is a consistent estimate. Further, for a given time series, the minimum integrated mean square error with which its spectral density may be estimated is determined, and evaluated for large sample sizes. Efficient estimates are defined as those which achieve, asymptotically, the minimum mean integrated square error. The asymptotic formulae derived are used to make a numerical comparison of some estimates which have been suggested. However, in this paper no conclusions are drawn or principles enunciated as to how to proceed in practice to estimate the spectral density.},

	abstract = {The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics — analyzing spatial data through statistical models — has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an "excellent book which will become a basic reference." This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes:  Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of models to disease mapping  Designed to accommodate the practical needs of the professional, it features a unified and common notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references. Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the decade, one that has begun to capture the imagination of professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology.},

It reads as a Cholesky-type factorization Γ (p)−1 = L(p)′Σ (p)−1L(p), where L(p) is lower-triangular and Σ (p)−1 is diagonal. Whereas this Cholesky-type factorization exists whenever Γ (p) is positive definite, Akaike derived a meaningful interpretation of L(p) and Σ (p)−1 in terms of finite predictor coefficients.

The test statistic evaluates, over all frequencies, the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the two estimated spectral density operators. Under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution under the null hypothesis is derived. A novel frequency domain bootstrap method is introduced, which leads to a more accurate approximation of the distribution of the test statistic under the null than the large sample Gaussian approximation derived. Under quite general conditions, asymptotic validity of the bootstrap procedure is established for estimating the distribution of the test statistic under the null. Furthermore, consistency of the bootstrap-based test under the alternative is proved. Numerical simulations show that, even for small samples, the bootstrap-based test has a very good size and power behavior. An application to a bivariate real-life functional time series illustrates the methodology proposed.},

A result on uniform convergence of spectral density estimates is established and applied in developing robust large-sample inference procedures based on instrumental variables estimates of a fairly general linear system with disturbances that have serial correlation of unknown form. Optimal instruments depend on the spectral density of the disturbances and on the frequency response function, and the latter is also nonparametric when the system is incomplete. The system may be parameterized over only a proper subset of the sampling frequencies. We adapt to these nonparametric features, justifying feasible, asymptotically optimal parameter estimates. The above results all assume covariance stationarity of the data, except for the special case of a multivariate linear regression model for which certain trending explanatory variables are permitted. In all these results, the degree of smoothing is allowed to depend on the data in a quite general way. The major technical achievement of the paper is to justify under primitive conditions the consistency of a particular, cross-validation, method of automatically determining a desirable degree of smoothing, which we apply to a multiple regression model. A Monte Carlo study illustrates our methodology and examines its performance in small and moderate samples.},

	abstract = {A new goodness-of-fit test for time series models is proposed. The test statistic is based on the distance between a kernel estimator of the ratio between the true and the hypothesized spectral density and the expected value of the estimator under the null. It provides a quantification of how well a parametric spectral density model fits the sample spectral density (periodogram). The asymptotic distribution of the statistic proposed is derived and its power properties are discussed. To improve upon the large sample (Gaussian) approximation of the distribution of the test statistic under the null, a bootstrap procedure is presented and justified theoretically. The finite sample performance of the test is investigated through a simulation experiment and applications to real data sets are given.},

	isbn = {978-1-119-11518-2},
	abstract = {The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics — analyzing spatial data through statistical models — has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an "excellent book which will become a basic reference." This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes:  Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of models to disease mapping  Designed to accommodate the practical needs of the professional, it features a unified and common notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references. Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the decade, one that has begun to capture the imagination of professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology.},

	abstract = {The theory of random functions is a very important and advanced part of modem probability theory, which is very interesting from the mathematical point of view and has many practical applications. In applications, one has to deal particularly often with the special case of stationary random functions. Such functions naturally arise when one considers a series of observations x(t) which depend on the real-valued or integer-valued ar­ gument t ("time") and do not undergo any systematic changes, but only fluctuate in a disordered manner about some constant mean level. Such a time series x(t) must naturally be described statistically, and in that case the stationary random function is the most appropriate statistical model. Stationary time series constantly occur in nearly all the areas of modem technology (in particular, in electrical and radio engineering, electronics, and automatic control) as well as in all the physical and geophysical sciences, in many other ap­ mechanics, economics, biology and medicine, and also plied fields. One of the important trends in the recent development of science and engineering is the ever-increasing role of the fluctuation phenomena associated with the stationary disordered time series. Moreover, at present, more general classes of random functions related to a class of stationary random functions have also been appearing quite often in various applied studies and hence have acquired great practical importance.},

	abstract = {A thin-tailed vector random field, referred to as a \$K\$-differenced vector random field, is introduced. Its finite-dimensional densities are the differences of two Bessel functions of second order, whenever they exist, and its finite-dimensional characteristic functions have simple closed forms as the differences of two power functions or logarithm functions. Its finite-dimensional distributions have thin tails, even thinner than those of a Gaussian one, and it reduces to a Linnik or Laplace vector random field in a limiting case. As one of its most valuable properties, a \$K\$-differenced vector random field is characterized by its mean and covariance matrix functions just like a Gaussian one. Some covariance matrix structures are constructed in this paper for not only the \$K\$-differenced vector random field, but also for other second-order elliptically contoured vector random fields. Properties of the multivariate \$K\$-differenced distribution are also studied.},

	abstract = {The concept of the autoregressive ({AR}) sieve bootstrap is investigated for the case of spatial processes in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. This procedure fits {AR} models of increasing order to the given data and, via resampling of the residuals, generates bootstrap replicates of the sample. The paper explores the range of validity of this resampling procedure and provides a general check criterion which allows to decide whether the {AR} sieve bootstrap asymptotically works for a specific statistic of interest or not. The criterion may be applied to a large class of stationary spatial processes. As another major contribution of this paper, a weighted Baxter-inequality for spatial processes is provided. This result yields a rate of convergence for the finite predictor coefficients, i.e. the coefficients of finite-order {AR} model fits, towards the autoregressive coefficients which are inherent to the underlying process under mild conditions. The developed check criterion is applied to some particularly interesting statistics like sample autocorrelations and standardized sample variograms. A simulation study shows that the procedure performs very well compared to normal approximations as well as block bootstrap methods in finite samples.},
