\section{Validity}

\subsection{Linear Deterministic Trend}
Given the low explanatory power and limited data, we must be very careful in drawing any substantive conclusions from these coefficients and thus also projections.

I also tried modeling the data with higher order polynomials (i.e. $\texttt{freq}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t +\beta_2 t^2 + \beta_3 t^3$) to also capture the mode, many of the clusters exhibited. And while the fit did improve, the models suffered from poor generalizability beyond the given time horizon (projected negative frequencies for the year 2026.).  

\subsection{Data considerations}

External validity is limited. The registry covers the United States, and both clinical practice and patient characteristics may differ elsewhere, potentially leading to different outcomes—particularly for face VCA. Nevertheless, the core pattern that longer ischemia times degrade organ quality and raise the risk of adverse events is biologically grounded and likely to generalize.
